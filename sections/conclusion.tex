\chapter{Conclusion}\label{ch:conclusion}

					In past three years, there was drastic outbreak of off shelf tools which is pluggable and reduced the implements done for software products. In this ever changing world of software development , it is extremely important to keep up with current technologies, methodologies and trends. This document has given an overview of software stack used in industrial environments for developing a software products and the frameworks that are widely used in current trend. Selection of the tools  is key in  developing a highly efficient software with good performance.
					
					Building a great software product depend on the development and management process. Agile method is one of the methods which really helps to standardize the management process which in turn impacts the development process. At first validate the problem that has to be solve. After getting clear understanding of the problem, build a prototype on the problem. This greatly helps in starting of development process. After validating the prototype , optimize and refine it. Select the most suitable technologies and framework which would help in building a minimum viable product for first iteration. Design and develop the minimum viable product. Follow iteration based development where development of group of features in each iterations.This gives a good result where the software is well tested and optimized to great extent.
